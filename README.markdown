# q - Text as Data
q is a command line tool that allows direct execution of SQL-like queries on CSVs/TSVs (and any other tabular text files).

q treats ordinary files as database tables, and supports all SQL constructs, such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`s, etc. It supports automatic column name and type detection, and q provides full support for multiple character encodings.

q's web site is [http://harelba.github.io/q/](http://harelba.github.io/q/) or [https://q.textasdata.wiki](https://q.textasdata.wiki) It contains everything you need to download and use q immediately.

## New beta version `3.1.0-beta` is available
Full Details [here](QSQL-NOTES.md), and an example of the caching is in [here](QSQL-NOTES.md#basic-example-of-using-the-caching).

This is the list of new/changed functionality in this version, large changes, please make sure to read it and the details link as well.

* **Automatic Immutable Caching** - Automatic caching of data files (into `<my-csv-filename>.qsql` files), with huge speedups for medium/large files. Enabled through `-C readwrite` or `-C read`
* **Direct querying of standard sqlite databases** - Just use it as a table name in the query. Format is `select ... from <sqlitedb_filename>:::<table_name>`, or just `<sqlitedb_filename>` if the database contains only one table. Multiple separate sqlite databases are fully supported in the same query.
* **Direct querying of the `qsql` cache files** - The user can query directly from the `qsql` files, removing the need for the original files. Just use `select ... from <my-csv-filename>.qsql`. Please wait until the non-beta version is out before thinking about deleting any of your original files...
* **Revamped `.qrc` mechanism** - allows opting-in to caching without specifying it in every query. By default, caching is **disabled**, for backward compatibility and for finding usability issues.
* **Save-to-db is now reusable for queries** - `--save-db-to-disk` option (`-S`) has been enhanced to match the new capabilities. You can query the resulting file directly through q, using the method mentioned above (it's just a standard sqlite database).
* **Only python3 is supported from now on** - Shouldn't be an issue, since q is a self-contained binary executable which has its own python embedded in it. Internally, q is now packaged with Python 3.8. After everything cools down, I'll probably bump this to 3.9/3.10.
* **Minimal Linux Version Bumped** - Works with CentOS 8, Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+. Currently only for x86_64. Depends on glibc version 2.25+. Haven't tested it on other architectures. Issuing other architectures will be possible later on

Full details on the changes and the new usage is in [here](QSQL-NOTES.md)

The version is still in early testing, for two reasons:

* Completely new build and packaging flow - Using [pyoxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer)
* It's a very large change in functionality, which might surface issues, new and backward compatibility ones

**Please don't use it for production, until the final non-beta version is out**

If you're testing it out, I'd be more than happy to get any feedback. Please write all your feedback in [this issue](https://github.com/harelba/q/issues/281), instead of opening separate issues. That would really help me with managing this.

## Installation.
**This will currently install the latest standard version `2.0.19`. See below if you want to download the `3.1.0-beta` version**

The current production version `2.0.19` installation is extremely simple. 

Instructions for all OSs are [here](http://harelba.github.io/q/#installation). 

### Installation of the new beta release
For now, only Linux RPM, DEB, Mac OSX and Windows are supported. Packages for additional Linux Distros will be added later (it should be rather easy now, due to the use of `fpm`).

The beta OSX version is not in `brew` yet, you'll need to take the `macos-q` executable, put it in your filesystem and `chmod +x` it. 

Note: For some reason showing the q manual (`man q`) does not work for Debian, even though it's packaged in the DEB file. I'll get around to fixing it later. If you have any thoughts about this, please drop me a line.

Download the relevant files directly from [The Beta Release Assets](https://github.com/harelba/q/releases/tag/v3.1.0-beta).

## Examples

```
q "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ./clicks_file.csv WHERE c3 > 32.3"

ps -ef | q -H "SELECT UID, COUNT(*) cnt FROM - GROUP BY UID ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 3"
```

Go [here](http://harelba.github.io/q/#examples) for more examples.

## Benchmark
I have created a preliminary benchmark comparing q's speed between python2, python3, and comparing both to textql and octosql. 

Your input about the validity of the benchmark and about the results would be greatly appreciated. More details are [here](test/BENCHMARK.md).

## Contact
Any feedback/suggestions/complaints regarding this tool would be much appreciated. Contributions are most welcome as well, of course.
